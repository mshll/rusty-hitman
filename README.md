## Testing

The game was continuously hand tested during development to ensure all components function as expected. The testing process involved verifying that the game mechanics, character spawning, timer, and score system worked correctly. There are no unit tests due to the nature of the project.


## Reflection

### What went well and what didn't

Overall, I'm pretty happy with how the project turned out. I was able to implement most of the features I wanted and the development process was a great learning experience. However, there is always room for improvement. I wanted to have the characters randomly wander around the level but I couldn't fully implement it due to time constraints. I also wanted to have better error handling instead of using `unwrap` but since the errors would only occur during development, I decided against it.

### Future improvements

- Make the characters randomly wander around the level area.
- Global leaderboard to track high scores.
- Add more game modes (Hard, Practice, etc.).
